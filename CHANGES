NEW IN VERSION 2
=====================================================================
- [Optimization] Moved the sigTfactor dynamic array allocation out
  of the inner program loop and back up to the top so millions of
  allocs/free's are saved. This appears to increase performance
  significantly (~33%) when compared to v1.
