- [Bug Fix] Fixed an issue with the window pole assignment
function (generate_window_params). There was a counter that was
not being properly incremented, causing some windows to be
assigned the same poles, and causing an issue with a border case
receiving many more poles than others. This issue has been fixed
so that all windows should now recieve about the same number of
poles, and all windows should be unique. This change effects
performance slightly, showing a 10-15% speedup in version 3
vs. version 2.

- [Optimization] Moved the sigTfactor dynamic array allocation out
  of the inner program loop and back up to the top so millions of
  allocs/free's are saved. This appears to increase performance
  significantly (~33%) when compared to v1.
